Emulated Terminal Resume

Intent
------

I wanted to create an interactive resume. As a web application developer, I thought, what better way to do that than a
web application that caters to other tech guys. So I built a quick angularjs app that emulates a terminal and allows for
an interactive resume.

Features
--------
Currently the page has code highlighting, tab completion, and a basic list of commands:
* help, ?
* clear, cls
* ls, dir, list
* cd, back
* pwd
* go
* contact
* build
* matrix
* version
* return
* test
* search
